Chocolate Flavor Data Set

Data Source: The source of this data set came from Kaggle. After further research, I identified the data came 
directly from Manhattan Chocolate Society - Home (flavorsofcacao.com). These ratings were compiled by 
Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. Although the data I pulled is 
from Kaggle, I believe the data can be deemed reliable. 

Data Collection:
This data was collected using administrative data and survey responses gathered from different 
chocolate tasting events. Administrative data is compiled based on the opinions of the Manhattan Chocolate Society 
Members as to the given rating.

This dataset contains information on the company (maker of the chocolate bar), its country of location,
chocolate bar name or bean origin, Percent of cocoa in the chocolate, Bean type, Bean origin and its 
rating and date of review.

There are 9 columns and 1512 rows in the dataset.

Data Limitations:
A limitation of the data is that the background of the consumers who rated the chocolate is unknown.
Some consumers can be biased towards certain criteria more than others. The chocolate rating is the 
result of an educated opinion about chocolate. The data started to become available in 2007.

Ethics:
This information is displayed on the sourceâ€™s website Manhattan Chocolate Society - Home 
(flavorsofcacao.com) as being available to the 
public. There does not appear to be any ethical concerns with the data
